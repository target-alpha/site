# Target Alpha website maintenance

Most annual updates require editing a single object in `src/content`. No page layout code needs to change.

> Edit source files only. `dist/` and `app.js` are generated and manual changes to them will be overwritten.

## Editing through Sanity

After the CMS setup in `SANITY.md` is complete, team members should edit and publish content through the hosted Sanity Studio. No GitHub editing, local build, or command line is required for routine content changes. The repository content documented below remains the emergency fallback and migration reference.

## Publishing an edit from GitHub (no local setup)

1. Open the repository on GitHub and navigate to the content file you need (for example, `src/content/team.js`).
2. Select the pencil icon (**Edit this file**), make the change, and use **Commit changes** to commit it directly to `main`.
3. GitHub Actions validates, builds, and publishes the site automatically. The update is normally live within a couple of minutes at https://sqhil-a.github.io/target-alpha-example/.

There is no need to run `npm`, edit `app.js`, or edit anything in `dist/` when using GitHub's browser editor. If the commit reports a failed check, open the linked Actions run; it will identify the content field that needs correcting.

## Updating the national team

Open `src/content/team.js`. The `nationalTeams` object is grouped by year. Each executive is one entry in that year’s `members` array:

```js
{
  name: "First Last",
  role: "Director of Operations",
  department: "Operations",
  year: "2026-27",
  legacyPath: "/first-last",
  image: "/images/team/2026-27/first-last.webp",
  bio: "Full biography goes here."
}
```

- Change a name, title, department, or biography in that one entry.
- Add an executive by copying one entry and updating every field.
- Remove an executive by deleting that one object, including its surrounding comma.
- The `department` value controls which section the profile appears in.
- `legacyPath` creates the executive’s profile URL. Keep an existing path unchanged to preserve old links.

## Changing a profile photo

1. Export a portrait as WebP or JPEG at roughly 1200 × 1500 px.
2. Put it in `public/images/team/<year>/`.
3. Change only the executive’s `image` property, for example:

```js
image: "/images/team/2026-27/first-last.webp"
```

The profile grid and biography page use the same image automatically. The current migration references the original Squarespace CDN so that every historical image remains available; new images should be stored locally.

## Creating the next year’s national team

1. Copy the newest year block inside `nationalTeams`.
2. Change its key, `year`, `path`, and member entries.

The year archive navigation and route are generated automatically from the team object. Keep the newest year block first; previous years remain available as archives without additional page work.

## Updating regional executives

Regional program copy and application details are in `src/content/regionalExecutives.js` under `regionalOverview`. Regional cohorts use the same yearly pattern under `regionalTeams`.

To create a new regional cohort, copy the newest year block, change its key, `year`, `path`, and members, and keep it first in `regionalTeams`. The archive navigation and route are generated automatically.

## Updating competitions

Open `src/content/events.js`. Each event supports:

- `acronym` and `fullTitle`
- `description` and optional `detailDescription`
- `statistic`
- `partner`
- `date`
- `registrationState` and `registrationUrl`
- `resourceLabel` and `resourceUrl`
- `image`

To add a competition, copy an event object and give it a unique `slug`. The homepage and events page render the new entry automatically. Use `null` for details that are not published; do not add placeholders.

## Updating homepage statistics

Edit the three entries in `src/content/stats.js`. The homepage ledger and the persistent national index line both use this file.

## Adding a judge

Open `src/content/judges.js` and add an object:

```js
{
  name: "First Last",
  bio: "Biography supplied by the judge.",
  competitions: ["2026 Stock Pitch Competition"],
  note: "They were a judge at Target Alpha’s 2026 Stock Pitch Competition.",
  year: "2026",
  image: "/images/judges/first-last.webp"
}
```

Reordering the array changes the display order. Deleting the object removes the judge.

## Adding a news feature

Open `src/content/news.js` and add one entry with `publication`, `headline`, `articleUrl`, optional `videoUrl`, optional `date`, and `image`. Never use `#` for an unpublished link - use `null` until the destination exists.

## Updating chapter links and registration

Chapter copy, registration status, steps, testimonials, and links are in `src/content/site.js` under `chapterContent`. Chapter resource destinations are in `chapterResources` in the same file.

The newsletter form identifiers are in `site.newsletter`. If Target Alpha moves away from Squarespace’s newsletter service, update the `action`, `formId`, and `collectionId` together.

## Updating sponsors, partners, contacts, or general imagery

- Sponsors: `sponsorLogos` in `src/content/site.js`
- Academic partners: `partners` in `src/content/site.js`
- Email addresses and social links: `site` in `src/content/site.js`
- About, homepage, chapter, and academia copy: their named objects in `src/content/site.js`
- General photos: store in `public/images/general/`
- Event photos: store in `public/images/events/`
- Judge photos: store in `public/images/judges/`
- News images: store in `public/images/news/`
- Partner marks: store in `public/images/partners/`

Use descriptive lowercase filenames with hyphens. If you are editing locally, run:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

Fix any reported missing route, placeholder link, or data-count issue before committing. When editing through GitHub's browser interface, these checks run automatically after the commit and the deployment is automatic.
